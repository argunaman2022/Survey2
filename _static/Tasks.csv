Stock-forecasting,"Participants had to forecast the price of a fictitious stock for 20 rounds. In each round, the actual price of the stock was determined based on two cues which were revealed to participants (for instance Cue_A= 10, Cue_B=20). Participants had to guess the stock price from these two cues. While these cues changed throughout the rounds, the exact relationship (price = 85+ 0.3 * Cue_A + 0.7*Cue_A) stayed the same. Although participants were told that the price depends on these two cues, the actual functional form was not communicated. Before they started the actual game, participants were given 10 examples to learn about the relationship.

An average person earned 100 points on this task.","An example task is depicted below. Here the correct answer is ""False"". Choosing ""False"" earned one point."
Visual-memory,"Participants had to solve as many Visual Memory tasks as possible within a given time. In each task, participants saw a deck of 12 cards on the screen. The hidden side of the cards contained images of various animals. Each animal was shown on 2 cards; in other words, there were 6 pairs of cards with the image of the same animal. Participants could to select two different cards at a time to find matching cards. Each time a matching pair was found, the two cards disappeared and participants earned one point.
