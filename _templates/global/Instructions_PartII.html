      Part II Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
      You have completed Part I. Several others have also completed Part I.

      <h5>
        <b>Your Task in Part II</b>
      </h5>
      
      You will see the same tasks again. 
      Whereas in Part I you guessed the performance of past study participants, in Part II, we are asking you to <b>guess the answers of those who have already completed Part I.</b>
      Therefore, here <b>the correct answer</b> is the true average guess of others in Part I.

      <br><br>
      <h5> 
        <b>Your Payment</b>
      </h5>
      Payment rules are the same as before. <br>
      <div style="color: gray;">
      In addition, you can earn a bonus payment of up to XXX\$. This <b>bonus depends on the accuracy of your guesses</b>.
      <br><br>
      One of the 13 tasks from either Part I or Part II will be chosen randomly to determine your payment.
      In this randomly chosen task, the closer your guess is to the true value, the higher your bonus payment will be. 
      If, for instance, your answer to this randomly selected question is exactly correct, you will earn a bonus of XXX$.
      If, however, your answer is 10% above or below the true value true value, you will earn a bonus of XXX $. 
      Therefore, in order to maximize your bonus, try to be as accurate as possible in your guesses. Payments will be made within a week of completing the study.
