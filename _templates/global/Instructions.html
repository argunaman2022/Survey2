      <h5>
        <b>Your task </b>
      </h5>
      You will be shown descriptions of 14 different tasks that <strong>other participants</strong> have played in previous studies. 
      These tasks were simple games, puzzles, etc.
      Each of these tasks was played with a different set of people.
      
       <br><br>
      This study has two parts. In Part I, for each of these tasks, we ask you to guess the average performance of women and men separately.
      In other words, <b>the correct answer</b> is the true average performance of men and women. 
      
      <br><br>
      In Part II, you will see the same tasks again.
      However, in this part you will make a different guess about the tasks. This, along with what the correct answer is, will be explained later.
      <br><br>

      

      <h5> 
        <b>Your payment</b>
      </h5>
      Your payment consists of a <b> completion payment </b> and a <b> bonus payment</b>. Conditional on successfully completing the study, you will receive a completion payment of XXX\$. 
      In addition, you can earn a bonus payment of up to XXX\$. Your <b>bonus depends on the accuracy of your guesses</b>.
      <br><br>
      One of the 14 tasks from either Part I or Part II will be chosen randomly to determine your bonus payment.
      In this randomly chosen task, the closer your guess to the correct answer, the higher your bonus payment will be. 
      If, for instance, your answer to this randomly selected question is exactly correct, you will earn a bonus of XXX$.
      If, however, your answer is 10% above or below the true value, you will earn a bonus of XXX $. 
      Therefore, in order to maximize your bonus, try to be as accurate as possible in your guesses. While you receive your completion payment right away, 
      your bonus payment will be made within a week of completing the study.
