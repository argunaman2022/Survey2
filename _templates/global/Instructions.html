        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Your Task</strong> <br>
        In this HIT, you will be shown 12 different tasks that have been used in previous studies. Each task was run on a different set of people.
        There are two parts. In part I, for each of the 12 tasks, we ask you to make an educated guess on how the average performance of men compares to the average performance of women.
        <strong>The closer your answer to the true value, the higher your bonus payment from part I.</strong> <br>
        <br>
        In each question, you will first see a description of the task. When you are ready to answer press the <strong>"I am ready to answer"</strong> button.
        Then submit your answer into the box that will appear using the <strong>"Next"</strong> button. <br>
        <br>
        Similarly in part II, for each of the 12 tasks, we ask you to make a guess on the average answer of other MTurkers to the questions in part I. In other words, in part I you will guess
        how well women and men performed in 12 tasks, while in part II you will guess the guesses of other MTurkers to the part I. The better you can guess other MTurkers' answers the higher your bonus payment from part II.
        <!-- TODO: rewrite this last one bit. -->

        <strong>Earnings</strong> <br>
        After the last question, you will see your total earnings which consist of three components. First, for completing the HIT you receive a <strong>reward</strong> of 0.5 USD.  <br>
        Second, in part I, one of the 12 questions will be randomly chosen to determine your <strong> bonus from part I </strong>. If, for instance, your answer to the randomly selected question is exactly correct, you will earn a bonus of 2 USD from part I.
        Third, similarly in part II, one of the 12 questions will be randomly chosen to determine your <strong> bonus from part II</strong> payment. If, for instance, your answer to this randomly selected question is exactly correct, you will earn a bonus of 2 USD from part II.
        If, however, your answer to the randomly selected question is 10% off the true value, you will earn a bonus of 1.6 USD
        (for an exact description of the bonus payment rule click <a id="myBtn"  onclick="button_click()"  style="color:blue; cursor:pointer" > here</a>).
        <br><br>
        <strong>Time limit</strong> <br> Please note that you have <strong> at most 1 hour </strong> to finish this HIT. If you do not finish within 1 hour, you will not be able to submit the HIT.
