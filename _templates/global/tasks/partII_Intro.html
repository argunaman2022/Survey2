        <p>
           You have completed part I. 
           Next, in <strong>Part II</strong>, you will see the same tasks you saw in <strong> Part I </strong>, but this time we ask you to guess how other people answered the part I questions.
           
           <br><br>
           The <strong>closer</strong> your guess is to the true answer of the average person, the <strong>higher your bonus payment</strong> will be from this part.
