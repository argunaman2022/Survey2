This is the first app - the Introduction app. It contains
1. Demgraphics page
2. Instructions that participants can always access
3. Comprehension checks 
4. and the first attention checks
Following are saved to the participant level
- Allowed: if they didnt fail the comprehension checks
- Comprehension_passed: whether they passed the comprehension checks
- Attention_1: whether they passed the first attention check
- Treatment: which treatment they are assigned to
